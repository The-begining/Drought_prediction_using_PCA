# Drought_prediction_using_PCA

The project report focuses on predicting drought levels in the US region using weather. The dataset includes 20 years of weather data with meteorological indicators and drought scores for 3109 counties. The available dataset is divided into training, validation, and test sets. Additionally, soil data with 32 features for each county is provided.
Various models are applied to the dataset, including Linear Regression, Ridge Regression, and Random Forest. The Ridge regression model is found to be more accurate than others. The project aims to investigate if drought scores can be predicted in advance and determine the most suitable model for this prediction task.
Feature selection methods such as interpolation, significant feature selection, and Principal Component Analysis (PCA) are employed to enhance model accuracy and reduce dimensionality. The report discusses the impact of elevation on drought levels and analyzes the correlation between different meteorological indicators. Visualization techniques like histograms and frequency plots are used to understand the variability of weather variables in different regions.
Overall, the project utilizes a combination of weather and soil data, along with various models and feature selection methods, to predict drought levels accurately. The findings highlight the importance of selecting significant features and employing advanced techniques like PCA for improving drought forecasting in the US region.
